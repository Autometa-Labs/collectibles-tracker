## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (v16 or higher) - only if running without Docker
- npm or yarn

### Quick Start with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd collectibles-tracker
```

2. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# The default configuration works with Docker Compose
cd ..
```

3. **Start the application with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Start MongoDB in a container with persistent data
- Build and start the Node.js API server
- Automatically seed the database with sample data
- Make the API available at `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Stop the application**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Alternative: Local Development Setup

If you prefer to run without Docker:

1. **Install MongoDB locally**
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install mongodb-community

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install mongodb

# Start MongoDB
mongod
```

2. **Update environment configuration**
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and change MONGODB_URI to: mongodb://localhost:27017/collectibles-tracker
```

3. **Install dependencies and start**
```bash
npm run install-all
cd server
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
