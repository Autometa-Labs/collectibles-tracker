# Project Brief: Collectibles Tracker

## Core Mission
Build a comprehensive platform for tracking collectible card values and managing personal collections, starting with Pokemon cards and designed to expand to Magic: The Gathering, sports cards, and other collectibles.

## Primary Goals
1. **Card Database Management**: Comprehensive database with sets, rarities, and market data
2. **Price Tracking**: Real-time price tracking across multiple conditions (Raw, PSA 9/10, BGS 9/10)
3. **Collection Management**: Personal collection tracking with purchase prices and portfolio values
4. **User Experience**: Secure authentication, search/filter capabilities, wishlist system
5. **Scalability**: Architecture designed for multi-category expansion

## Current Scope
- **Phase 1**: Pokemon card foundation with core API structure
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user system
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for categories, sets, cards, prices, users, collections

## Success Criteria
- Functional API with all core endpoints
- User authentication and collection management
- Pokemon card database with price tracking
- Scalable architecture ready for expansion
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Key Constraints
- Start with Pokemon cards only
- Backend-first approach (API before frontend)
- MongoDB for data persistence
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API design principles

## Future Vision
Multi-category platform supporting Pokemon, MTG, sports cards, and other collectibles with advanced features like trading, analytics, and mobile apps.
